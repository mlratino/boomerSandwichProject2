#### The Boomer Sandwich app is designed to help those of the Sandwich Generation (those taking care of their parents AND children) find information and resources that aid them with the tasks that they are faced with. It provides links to a variety of resources and a search tool for doctors, dentists, and drug stores, all of which are available to anyone who visits the website. There is also a personalized journal that is available to those who sign up for an account. The journal can be used to keep track of appointments, family history, or anything else the user wishes to have a list for.

#### When the user arrives at the website, they are welcomed with the message displayed below.

#### Instructions for the use of the journal are given at the top of the page. The user must enter all date/time information and an event. Can edit event or delete.

#### The user is logged out when the 'Log Off' link is clicked or the browser session is ended.

#### Node.js and express were used as our server and page presentation technology. Express-session was also used to store session information using a cookie on the client side. Passport and passport local were used for login and password handling. The bcrypt module was used to hash and salt the passord before storing it in the database. The database technologies used were mysql and sequelize. Local database protection utilized 'dotenv' and a .env file. The database was utilized to store user login and password information and to store entries and date time information from the user's personal journal. The code was uploaded to github and deployed on Heroku. A connection between Heroku and the local machine storage was accomplished by provisioning JAWSDB in Heroku and creating a mysqul
